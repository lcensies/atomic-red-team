      Enumerates started system services using net.exe and writes them to a file. This technique has been used by multiple threat actors.
      Upon successful execution, net.exe will run from cmd.exe that queries services. Expected output is to a txt file in in the temp directory called service-list.txt.

      This atomic test simulates System Service Discovery (T1007) by listing all units known to systemd on a Linux system. 
      It uses the `systemctl list-units` command to enumerate all units, which can provide valuable information about system services, 
      their statuses, and configurations. The output is redirected to a specified file, which should be cleaned up after the test.

    supported_platforms:
      - linux

    input_arguments:
      output_file:
        description: The file path where the output of the `systemctl list-units` command will be saved.
        type: String
        default: "/tmp/atomic_red_team_t1007_output.txt"

    executor:
      name: sh
      elevation_required: false
      command: |
        systemctl list-units > #{output_file}
      cleanup_command: |
        rm -f #{output_file}
